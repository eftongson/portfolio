      <h3>
This statement, as said by orientation speaker and 4A's associate Isiah Thompson, was one of the biggest takeaways I've had since my second MAIP experience.
<br><br>
Speaking up has always been a challenge for me, especially as an immigrant. In line with Filipinx culture, I was raised to stay quiet, to be obedient, and to remain humble.
However, I've learned that in order to be a successful designer and art director, I need to not only be clear in getting my visual ideas across, but also be able to tell a story and actively communicate with those around me.
<br><br>
Between my first MAIP experience and now, I've realized that my job isn't only to produce work, but to be in an environment where I must be unafraid to share and discuss with others in order to create the best work, and to foster an open, collaborative environment.
<br><br>
In hearing Isiah speak about speaking up, I was reminded that I am worthy of having a seat at the table, and should be more comfortable in taking up space, especially when voicing my needs and sharing my talents with the world.</h3>
